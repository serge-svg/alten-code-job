# Alten code job assessment

In the company's e-commerce database we have the PRICES table that reflects the final price (pvp) and the rate that applies to a product from a chain between certain dates.
Below is an example of the table with the relevant fields

### PRICES TABLE
![img.png](image/img.png)

### PRICES TABLE FIEDS
* BRAND_ID: brand foreign key (1 = ZARA)
* START_DATE,  END_DATE: date ranges to apply the indicated price rate
* PRICE_LIST: Applicable price rate identifier
* PRODUCT_ID: Product code identifier
* PRIORITY: If two rates coincide in a range of dates, the one with the highest priority (greatest numerical value) is applied.
* PRICE: final price
* CURR: iso currency

### TODO
* Build an application/service in SpringBoot that provides a query rest end point such that it accepts as input parameters
    * application date, product identifier, brand identifier
* Output data
    * product identifier, brand identifier, prices rate to apply, dates of application and final price
* H2 as mem database
